Static Class Members
	At the end of this presentation, you should be able to
		describe what a class variable is
		distinguish between instance and class variables
		be able to create and use class (static) variables and functions
		explain which member functions (class/non-static) can and cannot access which member variables (class/non-static)

-------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
	There two types of variables you can have in your class
		instance variables
		class (or static) variables
	Instance variables are
		used extensively
		what you're familiar with so far
		bound within the instance
	Class variables are 
		much less common
		shared among all instances of a class.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Instance Variables
	Instance variables are declared non-static.
	Each instance of the class will contain it's own unique copy of the those variables
	For Example:
	[[code]]
		class Fraction {
		private:
			int numerator;
			int denominator;
		};
	If you have 10 instances of the Fraction class, you'll have 10 numerators and 10 denominators

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Class Variables
	A class (or static) variable 
		is declared with the static keyword
		exists outside any instance of the class 
		is shared among all instances
		exists before any instance of the class is created
	For Example:
	[[code]]
		class Fraction {
		private:
			static bool autoReduce;
		};
	Class variables MUST also be declared outside the class, and can be initialized there.
	[[code]]
		bool Fraction::autoReduce=true;
	If you have 10 instances of the Fraction class, you'll only have 1 autoReduce variable

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Static Functions
	A class can contain static member functions.  These
		can access static variables, but not instance variables
		can be called BEFORE any instance of the class is created
	For Example:
	[[code]]
		class Fraction {
		private:
			static bool autoReduce;
		public:
			static void setAutoReduce(bool autoReduce);
		};	

		void Fraction::setAutoReduce(bool autoReduce) {
			this->autoReduce = autoReduce;
		}
	Static functions CANNOT access any instance variables
	non-static (instance) functions can access all member variables
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calling Static Functions
	Static functions are called using the Class scope identifier
	They can be called regardless of wether an instance of the class has been created
	[[code]]
		int main() {
			Fraction::setAutoReduce( true );
			...
			return 1;
		}
