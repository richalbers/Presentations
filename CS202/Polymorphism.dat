	Static binding 
		also called early or compile-time binding
		Used when we know what function will be called at compile time
	Dynamic binding 
		also called late or run-time binding
		Used when we don't know what function will be called until run time.
		Implmented using virtual keyword
	Polymorphism (greek for "many forms")
		Using common interface to access different functions 
		Typically means "member function overriding"
			A call to a member function will call/execute different functions depending on the type of object that invokes the function.
	vTable (virtual table)
		A method used to implement dynamic binding in many OO languages
		Also called virtual method table (VMT), virtual function table, virtual call table, dispatch table, or vftable
	Upcasting
		Using a derived class pointer to point to base class object
	Downcasting
		Using a base class pointer to point to a derived class object
		Requires an explict cast; not always safe
