The Shell, file system, and navigation
	At the end of this presentation you should be able to
		Explain what the shell is
		Explain how the file system is organized
		Navigate the file system with the command
		Explain what absolute and relative paths are and use them appropriately with commands
		
-------------------------------------------
The Shell
	The shell is the interface between the user and the operating system
		It takes keyboard commands from the user and passes them to the operating system to carry then out.
	There are several command line shells available
		sh - original Bourne shell
		ksh - Korn Shell
		bash - Bourne Again Shell
		zsh - shell used on Macs
	Each of these is an improvement upon the previous one, but all do the same basic job.

---------------------------------------------
File System
	File System
		The file system is organized in a hierarchical directory structure
		The top of the tree is root (/)
			All other directories are located in root, or a subdirectory below root
				[[simple diagram!https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/debian/book/figs/deb.0403.gif]]
		There are no drive letters (which windows uses), instead different devices are "mounted" at different points in the directory tree   
	Commonly referred to directory terms
		current working directory - the directory you're currently in
		home directory - Where a user's files are located.  When logging in, the current working directory is your home directory.
----------------------------------------------	
Navigation commands
	Commonly used navigation commands
		pwd- shows (prints) your current working directory	
		[[code]]
			pwd
		cd - changes to a new directory
		[[code]]
			cd /bin 
			cd /home/ralbers 
	Special directory "shorthand" names
		. -current directory
		.. -parent of current direcory
		~ -your home directory
		~someUserName -that users home direcory
		[[code]]
			cd ..
			cd ~
			cd ~ralbers
--------------------------------------------------
Absolute vs relative paths
	Any command that wants a directory or file name, can take an absolute or relative path to that directory or file
	Absolute paths are the complete path starting from root
		They always start with /
		Examples
		[[code]]
			cd /bin
			cd /home/ralbers
			cd /usr
	Relative paths are relative to the current working directory
		They do not start with /
		Examples
		[[code]]
			cd bin
			cd ..
