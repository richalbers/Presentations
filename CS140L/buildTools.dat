Build Tools
	At the end of this presentation you should be able to
		use g++ and explain it's common options 
		create, explain, and use makefiles
------------------------------------------------
compiler (g++)
	g++ is a c++ compiler commonly used on linux
		It compiles source files into object files
		It links object files and libraries
		It creates executables
	In it's simplest form, it's run like this
	[[code]]
		g++ hello.cpp
	By default it will complile and link, and the executable created is named a.out	
------------------------------------------------
common g++ options
	Compile options
		-c -compiles to .o files but does not link
		-g -adds debugging info to results for use by gdb
		-I<dir> -adds the directory to the list of directories searched for include files
		-Wall -sets warning level to all, so all warnings are generated
	Link options
		-o specifies the name of the final executable to be created (instead of a.out)
		-L<dir> -adds the directory the list of directoires searched for libraries
		-l<libname> -specifies a library to search for externals
------------------------------------------------
Practice
	Write a helloworld c++ program
		compile it with and without the -o options and view the results
		compile it with and without the -g option and view the results (take note of the file size)
	Create a .h and .cpp files named print.h/.cpp that contains a function that prints your name.
	Modify helloworld to include the print.h file and call the print() function
		compile each .cpp with the -c option and view the output
		compile both together and view the results
