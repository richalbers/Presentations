Ch12 - Vim
	At the end of this presentation you should
		explain what vi and vim are
		explain what the different vi modes are
		use vi or vim to edit a text file 
------------------------------------------------
Overview
	What is vim?
		vi - the original full-screen text editor on unix
		vim - An improved version of vi
	Why learn vim?
		It's always available
		It's lightweight and fast
		Many Universities use Linux, vim is the Linux text editor
		It's a requirement for PSUs CS program
	Note
		Emacs is the other common text Linux text editor
------------------------------------------------
Running vim
	If vim is ran with no arguments, it creates an empty file
	[[code]]
		vim
	If vim is provided a filename, it edits that file
	[[code]]
		vim somefile
	To exit
		:q	-quit
		:q!	-quit without saving changes
		:wq -save changes (write) and quit
------------------------------------------------
Modes
	Command Mode - All keystrokes are interpreted as commands
		The keystokes won't show up on the screen
		but the associated action will be done
	Insert Mode - Almost all keystrokes are inserted as text
		Whatever you type shows up
------------------------------------------------
Changing modes
	To get into command modes
		Press ESC
	To get into insert modes	
		i - insert before the current position
		a - insert after the current position (append)
		I - insert after first non-blank character in the current line
		A - insert at end of current line
		o - insert before current line
		O - insert after current line
	When in insert mode, it will say INSERT in lower left of screen
------------------------------------------------
Cursor Movement keys
	Moving cursor around is common, so keys to do so are under right hand on home row
	As with all commands, these only work in command mode
	Keys:
		h - move left
		j - move down
		k - move up
		l - move right
	Arrow keys also work, but are less efficient
------------------------------------------------
Moving to lines
	These commands move the cursor to specific lines
		gg takes you to the beginning
		G takes you to the end
			a line number followed by G takes you to that line 
		:10 - goes to line 10 
			: followed by any line number takes you to that line
	When using these, they will show up on the screen
------------------------------------------------
delete/replace/join
	Character modification
		x - deletes character under cursor
		rz - replaces character under cursor with z 
			z could be any character
		R - replaces multiple characters (ESC to exit)
	Line modification
		dd - deletes a line
		5dd - deletes 5 lines (any number can be used)
		J - joins current line with following line
----------------------------------------------------
Cut/Copy/Paste
	You can delete or yank (copy) a block
		5dd - deletes 5 lines starting with current
		5yy	- yanks (copies) 5 lines starting with current
	After deleting or yanking lines, they can be pasted somewhere else
		P pastes the selected block before the current line
		p pastes the selected block after current line
	Instead of specifying an number of lines to delete or yank, you can mark a line, then go to another line and delete or yank all lines between
		ma	- marks line as a (a can be any letter)
		y'a -yanks from current line to line marked a
------------------------------------------------
Fix indentation
	When programming, indentation in important, so there's a command to fix it
		gg=G fixes indentation
			gg - start at line 1
			= - fix indentation
			G - stop at last line
		gg=G also works
------------------------------------------------
File operations 
	File operations are done via command line mode
		When in command mode, : or / will put your cursor at the bottom for command entry.
			This is called command line mode.
	Command line commands
		:w - writes file to disk
		:w filename - writes file to disk using given filename
		:q - quits (exits)
		:wq - writes and quits
		:q! - quits without saving changes
-------------------------------------------------
Searching and Replacing
	Searching
		/sometext - searches forward for sometext  (sometext could be any text)
		/	- repeats previous search forward
		?sometext - searches backward for sometext
		?	- repeats previous search backwards
	Search and Replace
		:%s/sometext/newtext/g 	 
			% means all lines
			s means substitute
			sometext is the text to find
			newtext is the text to replace it with
			g means do all, not just first
		:1,5/sometext/newtext/g
			only does search/replace from lines 1-5
