Digitizing Sound Waves
	Sound waves properties [[img images/audio_sampling.gif]]]
		Amplitude
		Frequency
	To digitize, wave is "sampled" at periodic intervals 
		Sampling rate is measured in Khz
		Bit Depth is number of bits per sample 
	Tracks
		One track - Monaural
		Two Tracks - Stereo
	CD quality is 44.1Khz, 16 bit depth, stereo

--------------------------------------------
Sound File Formats
	Sound can be stored in a variety of file formats [[img images/Audio_Formats.jpg]]
	To process/interpret a sound file requires a codec (software)
	Uncompressed formats 		[[img images/Audio_Data_Sizes.gif]]
		.wav
			common on PCs
			large file size
		.midi - stores musical info (notes, durations, instruments, etc..), not sampled sound waves
			very small files	
	Uncompressed sound files can be quite large, therefore numerous compression algorithms and file formats have been created
-----------------------------------------
Lossless Sound File Formats
	Lossless Formats use math magic to alter the data to store it in less space
	Some common Lossless(no info is lost) formats are: 
		ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
			Originally proprietary, now open source
			stored in .mp4 container
		.wma lossless
			proprietary to Microsoft
		others...
	Higher compression rates can be achieved via lossly formats, so they are more common for downloading
------------------------------------------
Lossy Sound File Formats
	Lossy Formats discard less audible or meaningful sounds and then use math magic to alter the data to store it in less space
	Common Lossy Formats
		[[MP3!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3]] (MPEG-1 Layer 3) 
			common for downloading
			File Extension: .mp3
		[[AAC!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding]] (Advanced Audio Coding)
			designed to be successor to .mp3
			File extensions: .m4a, .m4b, .m4p, .m4v, .m4r, .3gp, .mp4, .aac
		[[WMA!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Audio]] (Windows Media Audio)
			proprietary to Microsoft
			File extensions: .wma
		others...

------------------------------------------
Sound Cards
	Sound card functionality is typically built into motherboard, but can be upgraded
	Sound ports
		Mini-audio connectors [[img http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6QR_qOso91Y/S_ZolTka23I/AAAAAAAAAZo/_OI4VXtjivc/s1600/example+sound+card.jpg]]
		Line out 
		Line in 
		Rear out 
		Analog/Digital out [[img https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/gameport_3.jpg]]
		Microphone
	DB connector (15 pin)	
		Joystick/MIDI port
	S/PDIF Connector [[img https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3LrLmbBk2rw9dxmGP9ruuf-970-80.jpg]]
			allows direct digitial connection to 5.1/7.1 speaker system 
	Examples
		[[Example1!https://www.newegg.com/creative-sound-blaster-audigy-fx/p/N82E16829102062]]
		[[Example2!https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Blaster-Audigy-Performance-Headphone/dp/B00EO6X7PG/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1509933722&sr=8-1-fkmr1&keywords=studio+audio+capture+pcie]]

Speaker Standards	
	Stereo [[img http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PmCtPsdiu-E/TBht8Wace4I/AAAAAAAAAFo/_GdL4lO4t8E/s1600/Logitech2.1speakers.jpg]]
		two speakers
	2.1
		pair of stereo speakers
		subwoofer [[img http://www.audioholics.com/images/img1.jpg]]
	5.1 
		front left, center, right,
		left surround, right surround,
		subwoofer
	7.1 [[img http://www.audioholics.com/images/img2.jpg]]
		5.1 + left and right rear
-------------------------------------------
Sound Card installation
	Since sound is a basic requirement, many motherboards have integrated sound cards
	You may want to install a separate card for better sound
	If upgrading 
		Disable the on-board sound in the BIOS
		Install the new card & drivers
		Plug speakers into the proper jacks in new card
		Enjoy

-------------------------------------------
Common Sound Problems
	Speaker volume can be controlled two ways
		via software 
		via hardware (volume control on speaker)
	If there's no sound, verfify both are turned up (and not muted)
	Other common connection issues
		Speakers plugged into the wrong jacks
		Speakers not plugged into the wall (many need external power source for a built in amp) 

--------------------------------------------
Video Capture
	Video Capture requires proper hardware/software
	Video files contain both audio and video tracks
		Must be synced (A/V snyc)
	Compressed tracks are wrapped in a container file
		.avi - Windows standard
		.mov - Apple
		.flv - Flash
		.ogg - Open source
	Codecs are required to process internal tracks
	
----------------------------------------------
Video Codecs
	There are many
		WMA, WMV, H.263, Vorbis, Theora, etc..
		[[Codec list from Wikipedia!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_codecs]]
	To see which are installed (on Win 10)
		Start Windows Media player
		Cntrl M, then Help->About
		Tech Support link, scroll down...
