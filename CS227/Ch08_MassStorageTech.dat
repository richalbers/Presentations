Overview
	Storage Mechanism [[img images/Drives.jpg]]
		Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
			Magnetic Platters
			Cheaper per GB, but slower
		Solid State Drive (SSD)
			Flash memory
			More expensive, but faster

------------------------------------------
Form Factors
	HDDs
		3.5" - desktop systems
		2.5" - laptops or desktops
	SSD
		2.5" - same as HDDs 	[[img images/mSata_M2.JPG]]
			SATA interface
		mSata (not common)
		M.2 - small circuit board
			Multiple sizes: 2242,2260,2280,22110
			SATA or PCIe/NVMe interface
-------------------------------------------
Solid State Drives (SSD)
	Have no moving parts [[img images/SSD.jpg]]
	Use Flash memory to store data
	Noiseless
	Much Faster than traditional HDDs
	More Expensive than traditional HDDs
	Potentially Shorter Life (10K to 100K erase/write cycles)
	Types of NAND
		MLC - Multi-level cell
			Slower, but less expensive
			Shorter life-span
		SLC - Single-level cell
			Faster, but more Expensive
			Longer life-span
	Lifespan is determined by maximum# read operations per cell
		When it reaches EOL, you'll still be able to read it
-------------------------------------------
Terms
	IDE - Integrated Device Electronics
	PATA - Parallel ATA (ribbon cables)
		term used interchangably with IDE
	SATA - Serial ATA (much smaller cable)
		much faster than PATA
		eSATA - external version
	AHCI - Advanced Host Controller Interface
		Used with SATA drives
		Enable it in BIOS before installing OS
	NVMe - Nonvolatile Memory Express
		Used with some M.2 drives

--------------------------------------------
Connecting Drives 
	2.5" & 3.5" drives
		PATA/IDE - ribbon cable (2 drives per cable)
		SATA - Thin cable (1 drive per cable)
	M.2
		mounts on Motherboard
--------------------------------------------
SATA details
	Utilizes thin data cable [[img https://www.cgdirector.com/wp-content/uploads/media/2022/04/Types-of-SATA-Cables.jpg]]
	Potentially Hot-swappable
	Much faster than PATA
	Versions
		Note: all speeds are given in bits, not Bytes.  And 1.5Gb/s was roughly equivalent to 150 MB/s of actual data transfer once overhead was accounted for.  Same applies to other speeds.
		SATA I (revision 1.x) - 1.5 Gb/s (150 MB/s) [[img https://www.cleverfiles.com/help/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/disk-SATA-1.jpg]]
		SATA II (revision 2.x) - 3 Gb/s (300 MB/s)
		SATA III (revision 3.x) - 6 Gb/s (600 MB/s) 
		SATA 3.2 - 16 Gb/s (2 GB/s)
		Cable Length - 1 meter
		eSATA - external SATA, 2 meter shielded cable
------------------------------------------
Drive Communication
	Parallal ATA Emulation (may be called compatibility mode)
		primairly for backwards compatibility
	AHCI - Advanced Host Controller Interface
		Necessary for hot-swapability
		Used by most SATA drives, some M.2 Drives
	NVMe - Non-Volatile Memory Express
		Allows commmunication through PCIe bus, provides much higher speeds
		Common with M.2 drives
-------------------------------------------
SCSI (scuzzy)
	Small Computer Systems Interface
	Commonly used on Servers to support large numbers of drives
	Supports 8 or 16 devices on one bus
	Devices are identified by a SCSI ID, oftentimes set using dip switches
	Ends of the bus need Termination
	There are numerous versions, types of cables, connectors, and terminators.
	SAS - Serial Attached SCSI
		SCSI based drive commands
		Hot-swappable
		Normally plugs into backplane, no cables
-------------------------------------------
RAID
	Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks [[img images/raid0.png]]
	RAID 0 - Striping - Better Performance, worse reliability
		Requires 2+ drives
	RAID 1 - Mirroring/Duplexing - Better Reliability, worse economics [[img images/raid1.gif]]
		Requires 2 drives
	RAID 5 - Striping with parity - Better Performance, Reliability, Economy [[img images/raid5.png]]
		Requires 3+ drives
	RAID 6 - Striping with extra parity 
		Enhanced Reliability (allows 2 drive failure) - Good Performance, Economy
		Requires 5+ drives
	RAID 10 (1+0) Striping of mirrored drives - Performance + Reliability + Expandability
	RAID 0+1 Mirroring of striped drives - Performance + Reliability
	RAID 50 (5+0) Striping of RAID 5 - Performance + Reliability
--------------------------------------------
RAID Misc
	Duplexing - RAID 1 with double hardware
		2 Drives
		1 cable and 1 disk controller per drive
		Improved performance and redundancy
	JBOD - Just a Bunch Of Disks (many disk ports)
	Hot Spare - Self healing
	RAID options - Hardware vs Software vs BIOS 
		Hardware RAID - Costly, fast, more RAID types, more interfaces, live mod of RAID type, hot spare, transferable.  Replacement risk.
		Software RAID - Cheap.  Less fast.  Less risk.
		BIOS RAID - Cheap.  May be less fast.  Not transferable.
