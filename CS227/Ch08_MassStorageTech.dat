Overview
	Storage Mechanism [[img images/Drives.jpg]]
		Traditional Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
			Magnetic Platters 
		Solid State Drive (SSD)
			Flash memory

------------------------------------------
Magnetic Platter Drives (HDD)
	Drives Geometry consists of [[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Cylinder_Head_Sector.svg/360px-Cylinder_Head_Sector.svg.png]]
		Heads (platters * 2)
		Cylinders (tracks)
		Sectors
	Spindle Speeds
		5400
		7200
		10000
		15000
	Form Factors
		3.5" - desktop systems
		2.5" - laptops or desktops
-------------------------------------------
Solid State Drives (SSD)
	Have no moving parts [[img images/SSD.jpg]]
	Use Flash memory to store data
	Noiseless
	Much Faster than traditional HDDs
	More Expensive than traditional HDDs
	Potentially Shorter Life (10K to 100K erase/write cycles)
	Types of NAND
		MLC - Multi-level cell
			Slower, but less expensive
			Shorter life-span
		SLC - Single-level cell
			Faster, but more Expensive
			Longer life-span
	Lifespan is determined by maximum# read operations per cell
		When it reaches EOL, you'll still be able to read it
-------------------------------------------
SDDs continued
	Form Factors			[[img images/mSata_M2.JPG]]
		2.5" (same is HDD)
			SATA interface
		mSATA
			SATA interface
		M.2
			SATA or PCIe/NVMe interface
-------------------------------------------
Terms
	IDE - Integrated Device Electronics
	ATA - Advanced Technology Atachment
	PATA - Parallel ATA (ribbon cables)
		sometimes called IDE
	SATA - Serial ATA (much smaller cable)
		much faster than PATA
		eSATA - external version
	AHCI - Advanced Host Controller Interface
		Used with SATA drives
		Enable it in BIOS before installing OS
	NVMe - Nonvolatile Memory Express
		Used with some M.2 drives

--------------------------------------------
PATA overview 
	Utilizes 40 or 80 wire cable [[img images/PATA_Cable.png]]
	Motherboard may have two interfaces (channels) [[img images/PATA_Cable2.jpg]]
		Primary
		Secondary
	Each interface supports two drives
		Master
		Slave
	Cable Length - 18 inches
	Setting the drive to "CS" allowed would cause it to be configured as either Master or Slave depending on it's position on the Cable (assuming it was a Cable Select cable)
	Handling - Remove connector via handle, or distribute force across cable.
	Problems - Ribbon cable air flow, performance limit

--------------------------------------------
SATA overview
	Utilizes thin data cable [[img https://www.cgdirector.com/wp-content/uploads/media/2022/04/Types-of-SATA-Cables.jpg]]
	Potentially Hot-swappable
	Much faster than PATA
	Versions
		Note: all speeds are given in bits, not Bytes.  And 1.5Gb/s was roughly equivalent to 150 MB/s of actual data transfer once overhead was accounted for.  Same applies to other speeds.
		SATA I (revision 1.x) - 1.5 Gb/s (150 MB/s) [[img https://www.cleverfiles.com/help/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/disk-SATA-1.jpg]]
		SATA II (revision 2.x) - 3 Gb/s (300 MB/s)
		SATA III (revision 3.x) - 6 Gb/s (600 MB/s) 
		SATA 3.2 - 16 Gb/s (2 GB/s)
		Cable Length - 1 meter
		eSATA - external SATA, 2 meter shielded cable
-------------------------------------------
SCSI (scuzzy)
	Small Computer Systems Interface
	Commonly used on Servers to support large numbers of drives
	Supports 8 or 16 devices on one bus
	Devices are identified by a SCSI ID, oftentimes set using dip switches
	Ends of the bus need Termination
	There are numerous versions, types of cables, connectors, and terminators.
	SAS - Serial Attached SCSI
		SCSI based drive commands
		Hot-swappable
		Normally plugs into backplane, no cables
------------------------------------------
Interfaces/Busses
	Bus (data connnection or interface)
		HDD
			IDE (EIDE, ATAPI, PATA - Parallel ATA)
			SATA (Serial ATA)
			eSATA  (External SATA, this is not SATAe)
			SCSI (typically in Servers)
			Serial Attached SCSI, (SAS)
			Fiber Channel (typically only on Servers)
			USB
		SSD
			IDE (PATA - Parallel ATA)
			SATA (Serial ATA)
			USB
			SATAe (SATA 3.2, PCIe lanes on SATA connectors)
			mSATA (mini-SATA, PCIe lanes on special slot)
			M.2 (replaces mSATA, uses PCIe lanes on special slot)
			U.2, (was SFF-8639, uses PCIe 3.0 x4, better thermal)
			NVMe (protocol, replaces AHCI)
---------------------------------------------
AHCI
	BIOS can support SATA drives typically in three modes
		Parallal ATA Emulation (may be called compatibility mode)
		AHCI - [[Advanced Host Controller Interface!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHCI]]
		RAID - Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks
	AHCI 
		is configured in BIOS
		supported in Vista/7/8/10
		necessary for hot-swappablility

-------------------------------------------
RAID
	Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks [[img images/raid0.png]]
	RAID 0 - Striping - Better Performance, worse reliability
		Requires 2+ drives
	RAID 1 - Mirroring/Duplexing - Better Reliability, worse economics [[img images/raid1.gif]]
		Requires 2 drives
	RAID 5 - Striping with parity - Better Performance, Reliability, Economy [[img images/raid5.png]]
		Requires 3+ drives
	RAID 6 - Striping with extra parity 
		Enhanced Reliability (allows 2 drive failure) - Good Performance, Economy
		Requires 5+ drives
	RAID 10 (1+0) Striping of mirrored drives - Performance + Reliability + Expandability
	RAID 0+1 Mirroring of striped drives - Performance + Reliability
	RAID 50 (5+0) Striping of RAID 5 - Performance + Reliability
--------------------------------------------
RAID Misc
	Duplexing - RAID 1 with double hardware
		2 Drives
		1 cable and 1 disk controller per drive
		Improved performance and redundancy
	JBOD - Just a Bunch Of Disks (many disk ports)
	Hot Spare - Self healing
	RAID options - Hardware vs Software vs BIOS 
		Hardware RAID - Costly, fast, more RAID types, more interfaces, live mod of RAID type, hot spare, transferable.  Replacement risk.
		Software RAID - Cheap.  Less fast.  Less risk.
		BIOS RAID - Cheap.  May be less fast.  Not transferable.
