	Serial
	USB
	Firewire
	Thunderbolt
	Keyboards
	Mice & Pointing Devices
	Other Devices

--------------------------------------------
Serial Ports
	Old, but simple and functional
	Still used to interface with modems, some networking equipment, or industrial hardware
	Uses 9pin male connector
		If your motherboard does not have this connector, it still may support serial via header pins on the board to which a 9 pin connector could be attached
	Referred to as COM ports in software
	Replaced by USB for computer peripherals
--------------------------------------------
USB - Universal Serial Bus
	Multiple devices on a single connection[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Usb_connectors.JPG]]
	Designed to replace serial, parallel, & PS/2	     [[img https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2020/09/d6e91d51.jpg]]
	Versions 						
		1.1 - White, 1.5M, 12Mbps (lowspeed, fullspeed)	
		2.0 - Black, 480 Mbps (highspeed)			[[img images/USB DVI VGA HDMI DisplayPort.jpg]]
		3.0 - Blue, 5 Gbps (superspeed)
		3.1 - Teal, 10Gbps (superspeed USB 10 or USB 3.1 Gen 2)
		All are backwards compatible
	Connectors 		
		Computer - Type A, mini A, micro A, Type C
		Device - Type B, mini B (5 or 8 pin), micro B, Type C
	With USB, you typically install the drivers BEFORE plugging in the device - RTM
