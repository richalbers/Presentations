-------------------------------------------------
Display Properties
	Resolution - horizontal pixels x vertical pixels [[img imgages/Resolutions.png]]
		This also determines aspect ratio	[[img https://i.rtings.com/assets/pages/A6Sdhc3U/monitor-aspect-ratio-large.jpg]]
	Brightness - how bright is image
	Viewing angle - how far off center can image be viewed [[img https://www.schoolmarquee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Different-Viewing-Angle-of-LED-screen-600x311.jpg]]
	Response rate - time to go from black to white (ms)
	Refresh rate - how often screen updates (Hz)
	Contrast ratio - difference between darkest and brightest
	Color depth - number of different colors (bits)
-------------------------------------------
Display Types
	Flat Panel Displayes
		LCD 
		OLED
	Projectors
	Virtual Reality Headsets
--------------------------------------------
LCD Monitors
	Components
		backlight (and diffuser) lights up the panel [img LCD_Panel.png]]
			CCFL, require high AC voltage, provided by inverter
				Now obsolete
			LED, lower power, thinner, brighter
				All LCD Monitors now have LED backlights
		Liquid Crystal Display Panel - creates the image
-------------------------------------------------
OLED Monitors
	OLED panels create their own light, so no backlight is necessary
	Advantages over LCD (LED) panels:
		Deeper blacks
		Higher contrast
		Larger viewing angles
		Thinner
		Can be transparent when off
	Disadvantages
		Cost
------------------------------------------
Projectors
	Project image onto screen
	Technologies
		LCD (light shines through LCD panel)
			Less expensive
		DLP (Tiny mirrors project image)
			Better image / less maintenance 
--------------------------------------------
Projector Properties
	Lumens - brightness
		1000-1500 sufficient for small dark room
		2000+ for mid-sized lighted room
		10000+ large lighted rooms	
	Throw - distance of projector from screen
		Ultra-short / short / normal
	Light Source
		Lamps
			get hot, need fans
			lamps last aprox 3000 hours and are expensive
		LED-based
			much less heat, quieter
			30,000+ hour lifespan
		laser
			expensive
------------------------------------------
Monitor Connections - legacy
	VGA (RGB, DSub15)  [[img images/VideoConnectors.png]]
	DVI (Digital Video Interface) [[img images/DMS_59.jpg]]
		Several Flavors
			DVI-A - analog
			DVI-D - digital
			DVI-I - integrated (both)
			Single link and Dual Link version
		DVI-I and D
			Single link - lower resolutions
			Dual Link - higher resolutions
	DMS-59
		Provided 2 DVI (or VGA) connections with a single port 
		Mentioned here because it's easily mistaken for DVI
	An adapter can sometimes be used to convert from one type to another (but not always)
------------------------------------------
Monitor Connections - current
	HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) [[img images/VideoConnectors.png]]
		Loosely described as: DVI + Audio
	DisplayPort
		Carries video, audio, and data [[img images/VideoConnectors2.png]]
		Can support multiple monitors
	Thunderbolt
		Carries video, audio, and data 
		Thunderbolt 1 and 2 use Mini DisplayPort connector
		Thunderbolt 3 uses USB Type-C
	An adapter can sometimes be used to convert from one type to another (but not always)
---------------------------------------------
Monitor Connections - other devices
	Legacy [[img images/VideoAdapters.jpg]]
		[[S-Video!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Video]] 
		[[Composite!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connector]] (RCA port)
		[[Others!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_display_interfaces]]	
	HDBaseT
		Used by some projectors
		Allows logn-range connectivity over Cat 5a or 6 network cables	
------------------------------------------
Monitor Mounts
	VESA mounts - standardized bracket for mounting monitors [[img images/VesaMount.png]]
		Adapters are available				[[img images/VesaAdapter.png]]
------------------------------------------
Display Adapter
	Display Adapters (i.e. video cards) generate and Output images to a display [[img images/VideoCard1.jpg]]
	Video									[[img images/VideoCard2.png]]
		Deals with lots of information
		requires very high bandwidth
		requires lots of processing power
	Video card Contains 
		Video Circuitry
			Evolved into specialized GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
			NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel make most current GPUs
		Memory
			Typically faster than system RAM
			GDDR 4/5/5x/6/6x
	Some motherboards have integrated video
	Many modern CPUs also have integrated video
--------------------------------------------
Busses / Expansion Slots
	PCI
		adequate for general use
		Bandwidth is shared for all devices on bus
		Video often requires more bandwidth
	AGP
		Dedicated to Video
		Not general purpose
		Now obsolete
	PCIe x 16
		Current standard

------------------------------------------
Replacing Video card
	Remove any software related to your old card
	Uninstall the driver for the old card (device mgr)
	Shut off PC
	Remove old card, install new card
	Reboot (system will use generic VGA driver to boot)
	Install new driver & Software
		From Optical media or network (best)
	Configure video properties
---------------------------------------------
Multiple Displays
	Windows supports multiple displays since XP
	Many video cards support dual displays (some quad)
		Referred to as "dual head"
		multiple VGA, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort connections
	You can also use multiple video cards
		You may need to modify video settings in BIOS
-------------------------------------------
Direct X
	A set of programming APIs for handling multimedia tasks used in game programming
	Almost all Windows games use DirectX and video cards support it
	Latest version: DirectX 12
		Only works with Win 10
		Successor is Vulcan
	To determine the version on your PC, run DxDiag from run menu

-------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
	Video cards rarely fail
	Wrong driver will cause problems
		You can boot into safe mode and update driver
