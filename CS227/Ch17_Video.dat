Display Types
	LCD Monitors
	Projectors
	Virtual Reality Headsets
--------------------------------------------
LCD Monitors
	Components
		backlight (and diffuser) lights up the panel [img LCD_Panel.png]]
			CCFL, require high AC voltage, provided by inverter
				Now obsolete
			LED, lower power, thinner, brighter
				All monitors now have LED backlights
		Liquid Crystal Panel - creates the image
-------------------------------------------------
LCD Properties
	Resolution - horizontal pixels x vertical pixels [[img https://i.rtings.com/assets/pages/A6Sdhc3U/monitor-aspect-ratio-large.jpg]]
		This also determines aspect ratio
	Brightness - how bright is image
	Viewing angle - how far off center can image be viewed [[img https://www.schoolmarquee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Different-Viewing-Angle-of-LED-screen-600x311.jpg]]
	Response rate - time to go from black to white (ms)
	Refresh rate - how often screen updates (Hz)
	Contrast ratio - difference between darkest and brightest
	Color depth - number of different colors (bits)
------------------------------------------
Monitor Connections
	VGA (RGB, DSub15)  [[img images/VideoConnectors.png]]
	DVI (Digital Video Interface) [[img images/DMS_59.jpg]]
		Several Flavors
			DVI-A - analog
			DVI-D - digital
			DVI-I - integrated (both)
			Single link and Dual Link version
		DVI-I and D
			Single link - lower resolutions
			Dual Link - higher resolutions
	DMS-59
		Provided 2 DVI (or VGA) connections with a single port 
		Mentioned here because it's easily mistaken for DVI
------------------------------------------
Monitor Connections (continued)
	HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) [[img images/VideoConnectors.png]]
		Loosely described as: Single-link DVI + Audio
		Associated software includes HDCP (high-def Content Protection)
	DisplayPort
		Supports higher bandwidth than HDMI [[img images/VideoConnectors2.png]]
		Manufacturers can use it "royalty free" (HDMI requires royalties)
	Thunderbolt
		Thunderbolt 1 and 2 use Mini DisplayPort connector
		Thunderbolt 3 uses USB Type-C
	For other video devices [[img images/VideoAdapters.jpg]]
		[[S-Video!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Video]] 
		[[Composite!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connector]] (RCA port)
		[[Others!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_display_interfaces]]
	An adapter can sometimes be used to convert from one type to another (but not always)
------------------------------------------
Video Cards
	Video cards (i.e. display adapters) generate and Output images to a display [[img images/VideoCard1.jpg]]
	Video									[[img images/VideoCard2.png]]
		Deals with lots of information
		requires very high bandwidth
		requires lots of processing power
	Video card Contains 
		Video Circuitry
			Evolved into specialized GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
			NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel make most current GPUs
		Memory
			Typically faster than system RAM
			DDR, DDR2, GDDR3/4/5
	Some motherboards have integrated video
	Many modern CPUs also have integrated video
--------------------------------------------
Busses / Expansion Slots
	PCI
		adequate for general use
		Bandwidth is shared for all devices on bus
		Video often requires more bandwidth
	AGP
		Dedicated to Video
		Not general purpose
		Now obsolete
	PCIe x 16
		Current standard

------------------------------------------
Replacing Video card
	Remove any software related to your old card
	Uninstall the driver for the old card
	Shut off PC
	Remove old card, install new card
	Reboot (system will use generic VGA driver to boot)
	Install new driver & Software
	Configure video properties

---------------------------------------------
Multiple Displays
	Windows supports multiple displays since XP
	Many video cards support dual displays (some quad)
		Referred to as "dual head"
		multiple VGA, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort connections
	You can also use multiple video cards
		You may need to modify video settings in BIOS
-------------------------------------------
Multiple GPUs - one display
	High-end video cards can use multiple video cards/GPUs to drive one display
	Each card shares part of the workload to create the image
	Two cards are installed and connected with a bridge
	Nvidia technology 
		SLI - Scalable Link Interface (obsolete)
		NVLink - replaces SLI
		Allows 2-4 GPUs
		GPUs MUST be same series
	AMD (previously ATI) technology
		CrossFire / CrossfireX
		still supported, but no longer made
	Not very common, modern cards are very good
-------------------------------------------
Direct X
	A set of programming APIs for handling multimedia tasks used in game programming
	Almost all Windows games use DirectX and video cards support it
	Latest version: DirectX 12
		Only works with Win 10
	To determine the version on your PC, run DxDiag from run menu

-------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
	Video cards rarely fail
	Version 1 AGP cards could creep out of slot
		Simply reseat
	Wrong driver will cause problems
		You can boot into safe mode and update driver
