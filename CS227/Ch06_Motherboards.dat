Form Factor
	Form factor defines 	[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Motherboards_form_factors.svg/719px-Motherboards_form_factors.svg.png]]
		the size of the motherboard
		general location of components and ports
	Form Factors 	
		Obsolete		[[img http://library.thinkquest.org/C0115420/Cyber-club%20800x600/Gif/pics/PC%20Tech%20Guide/MB%20NLX.gif]]
			AT - The Original!
			LPX & NLX - slimline
			BTX - designed to address P4 heat issues, but was shortlived
		Current		[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/VIA_Mini-ITX_Form_Factor_Comparison.jpg]]
			ATX - Old, but still most common
				Standard, Micro, Flex
			ITX - Small Form Factor (SFF)
				Mini, Nano, pico

Components on Motherboard
	BIOS/EUFI & CMOS			
	Processor Socket
	Chipset
	Memory Slots 
	Disk Drive Connectors (SATA/PATA)
	Expansion Busses/Slots
	Integrated components 

-----------------------------------
Chipset Evolution
	Chipsets used to consist of two primary chips, Northbridge and Southbridge
		Northbridge 									
			Originally was mostly a memory controller	[[img https://www.targetpc.com/hardware/motherboards/dfiwt70/850_block_diagram.gif]]
			Then high speed I/O was added to it			[[img https://images.anandtech.com/reviews/cpu/intel/SNBE/X79_blockdiagram.jpg]]
			Then memory controller was moved to CPU		[[img https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i7-10700k/images/arch6.jpg]]
		Southbridge
			Low speed I/O hub
			Originally connected to northbridge
			Now directly connected to CPU (because northbridge is gone!)
				And now sometimes called the northbridge...
	Block diagrams on the right show the evolution of the chipsets
		Intel
			Pentium 4
			Core 2
			2nd  Generation i7
			10th Generation i7
		AMD
			APU (Accelerated Processing Unit)
				APUs a marketing term for a combined CPU/GPU 
---------------------------------------
Expansion Busses/Slots
	Expansion busses/slots allow you to "expand" the capabilities of your computer
	Current Common Ones			
		PCI - Peripheral Component Interconnect [[img images/PCI_Keying.png]]
			General purpose, been around a long time
			3.3v (uncommon), 5.0v (common), or Universal
		PCIe - PCI Express  [[img http://ww2.justanswer.com/uploads/operab/2010-07-08_021703_PCI_PCIe_Slots.jpg]]
			Newest expansion bus - general purpose
			Works in software like PCI, but hardware is completely different
			Utilizes from 1 to 32 "lanes"
---------------------------------------
Expansion Busses/Slots Continued
	Obsolete 		[[img http://www.csepedia.com/Images/Peripherals/AGP_PCA_ISA.jpg]]
		ISA - Industry Standard Architecture
			Original expansion slot.  
		AGP - Accelerated Graphics port
			Only used for video 
	Others 		[[img images/pci-slots.jpg]]
		[[PCI-X!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI-X]] - PCI extended 
			64-bit PCI bus used in high-end workstations and servers
		Mini-PCI
			Laptop PCI form factor
-----------------------------------
Onboard Components
	As motherboards evolved, they've included components that used to be available only with expansion cards [[img images/MB_Ports3.jpg]]
	Examples:				 [[img images/MB_Ports2.jpg]]
		USB/Firewire
			Ports on back
			Connections to ports on case
		Sound 				[[img images/MB_Ports.jpg]]
		Video
		Modems
		NIC (Network Interface Cards)
	Drivers for on-board components are obtained from the motherbaord manufacturer
		Optical media (shipped with motherboard)
		Website - for up-to-date drivers
			For example: [[The ASRock Z87E-ITX Page!http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z87E-ITX/index.us.asp]]
