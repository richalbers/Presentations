Form Factor
	Form factor defines 	[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Motherboards_form_factors.svg/719px-Motherboards_form_factors.svg.png]]
		the size of the motherboard
		general location of components and ports
	Form Factors 	
		Obsolete		
			AT - The Original!
			LPX & NLX - slimline
			BTX - designed to address P4 heat issues, but was shortlived
		Current		[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/VIA_Mini-ITX_Form_Factor_Comparison.jpg]]
			ATX - Old, but still most common
				Standard, Micro, Flex
			ITX - Small Form Factor (SFF)
				Mini, Nano, pico

Components on Motherboard
	BIOS/EUFI & CMOS			
	Processor Socket
	Chipset
	Memory Slots 
	Disk Drive Connectors (PATA/SATA/M.2)
	Expansion Busses/Slots
	Integrated components 

-----------------------------------
Chipset Evolution
	Chipsets used to consist of two primary chips  	[[img https://images.hothardware.com/static/articleimages/Item845/p965_block.png]]
		Northbridge originally handled RAM	[[img https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Intel-Z690-chipset-block-diagram.jpg]]					
		Southbridge handled expansion devices	
	and a Super I/O chip for legacy devices			
	CPU now handles a lot of what the chipset used to		
	Block diagrams on the right show the evolution of the chipsets
		Intel
			Core 2
			12th Generation i series
		AMD
			APU (Accelerated Processing Unit)
				APUs a marketing term for a combined CPU/GPU 
---------------------------------------
Expansion Busses/Slots
	Expansion busses/slots allow you to "expand" the capabilities of your computer
	Current Common Ones			
		PCI - Peripheral Component Interconnect [[img images/PCI_Keying.png]]
			General purpose, been around a long time
			3.3v (uncommon), 5.0v (common), or Universal
		PCIe - PCI Express  [[img http://ww2.justanswer.com/uploads/operab/2010-07-08_021703_PCI_PCIe_Slots.jpg]]
			Newest expansion bus - general purpose
			Works in software like PCI, but hardware is completely different
			Utilizes from 1 to 32 "lanes" (1/4/8/16/32)
---------------------------------------
Expansion Busses/Slots Continued
	Obsolete 		[[img images/AGP_PCI_ISA.jpg]]
		ISA - Industry Standard Architecture
			Original expansion slot.  
		AGP - Accelerated Graphics port
			Only used for video 
	Others 		[[img images/pci-slots.jpg]]
		[[PCI-X!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI-X]] - PCI extended 
			64-bit PCI bus used in high-end workstations and servers
		Mini-PCI
			Laptop PCI form factor
-----------------------------------
Onboard Components
	As motherboards evolved, they've included components that used to be available only with expansion cards [[img images/MB_Ports3.jpg]]
	Examples:				 [[img images/MB_Ports2.jpg]]
		USB/Firewire
			Ports on back
			Connections to ports on case
		Sound 				[[img images/MB_Ports.jpg]]
		Video
		Modems
		NIC (Network Interface Cards)
	Drivers for on-board components are obtained from the motherbaord manufacturer
		Optical media (shipped with motherboard)
		Website - for up-to-date drivers
