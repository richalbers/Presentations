Partitioning Basics
	A Partition is a subdivision of a disk that can be used to store files (via a file system)
	Disks can have multiple partitions
		Each partition looks to the end user like a separate disk
		In windows, each partition typically gets a drive letter
		The install process and/or disk managment tool allows you to work with partitions
	Why have multiple Partitions?	
		To build a multi-boot system supporting several OSs, each in it's own partition
			This is less common since the advent of VMs
		To provide separate partions for Software and Data
		To provide a non-accessible-to-the-user partition for essential system files 

------------------------------------------
Partitioning Schemes
	Three partitioning schemes
		MBR - Industry standard
		Dynamic Disks - Proprietary Microsoft Technology
		GPT - Industry standard replacement for MBR
	Microsoft refers to MBR and GPT partitioned disks as basic disks, a name they created after they invented Dynamic Disks
	Only Microsoft supports Dynamic Disks
-------------------------------------------
MBR Disks
	First Sector of drive (Master Boot Record) contains
		MBR Program
		Partition Table
	Partitions (up to 4)
		Primary
			These are bootable
		Extended (only 1)
			Must contain Logical Drives 
			These are not bootable
	Maximum partition size is 2.2 TB
	File systems are put on primary partitions and logical drives
	These names (especially "logical drives") is less than ideal
-------------------------------------------
MBR Disks continued
	Partition containing O.S. boot files is marked active
	The first sector of each partition is called the partition boot sector
	Booting
		MBR program is loaded
		MBR program loads volume boot sector from active partition 
		Partition Boot Sector loads first O.S. boot program

--------------------------------------------
Dynamic Disks
	Proprietary Microsoft technology introduced with Windows 2K and supported only by Microsoft OSs
	Partitions replaced with Volumes, no logical drives
	MBR still there for backwards compatibilty
	Volume info is stored in a small hidden volume at the end of the disk

--------------------------------------------
Dynamic Disk Volume Types
	Non-redundant - Supported by Windows Client OSs since 2K
		Simple - similar to an old primary partition
		Spanned - allows volume to span multiple disks (32)
		Striped (RAID 0)
	Redundant - Supported only by Windows Server OSs since 2K
		Mirrored (RAID 1)
			Also supported in Windows 7 Pro or better!
		RAID 5
-------------------------------------------
GPT Disks
	Globally Unique Identifer (GUID) Partition Table
	Similar to MBR but limitations have been fixed
		Lots of Partitions (128 on MS systems)
		Maximum Partition size in Zettabytes!
			1 Zettabyte is 1 million terrabytes!
		Eliminates LBA->CHS trickery
	Utilizes GPT Header in place of MBR sector
		Has a copy of this header at the beginning and ending of the disk for redundancy.
--------------------------------------------
Other Partition Types
	Hidden partition - A partition that is hidden from the OS
		Some Computer manufactures put one of these on the disk to contain a backup copy of the OS.
			Commonly referred to as a "factory recovery partition"
	Swap Partition - a partition used by Linux in place of a swap file
------------------------------------------
Vocabulary/Terms Summary
	Physical Partitions of the Disk
		Partitions - MBR & GPT
		Volumes* - Dynamic (Microsoft terms)
	Logical Disks - what user/OS see as drive
		Partitions (MBR & GPT)
		Logical drive in extended partition (MBR)
		Volumes* - Dynamic 
			Simple, Span, Stripe, Mirror, RAID5
	Microsoft Disk Types
		Basic - MBR & GPT
		Dynamic 
	* The term Volume is used for two different things
--------------------------------------------
File System Basics
	Partitions/Volumes need file systems to manage the disk space
	Disk drives manage the space at the sector level, but a sector (512 bytes) is so small there's too many of them for the OS to manage effeciently.
	File systems break the disk space into manageable chunks called clusters
	File Systems keep track of what clusters are used by what files
	A file takes up at least 1 cluster.
	Large clusters result in lots of wasted space
		If clusters are 32K, a 1 byte file takes up 32K of disk space
-------------------------------------------
Windows File Systems
	FAT
		Supported by all Microsoft OSs since DOS
		Utilizes a File Allocation Table
		Versions: FAT16 & FAT32
		FAT32 supports partitions up to 2 TB
			but Windows can only format FAT partitions up to 32GB
	NTFS
		Introduced with NT, and supported by all versions of NT (NT/2K/XP/Vista/7/10)
		Very similar to UFS (Unix File System)
		Utilizes Master File table
		Usable on partitions up to
			2 TB on basic disks
			16 TB on dynamic disks
-------------------------------------------
NTFS Features
	More efficient use of space (smaller clusters)
	Excellent Security (using ACLs)
	Compression
	Encryption
	Disk Quotas
--------------------------------------------
Disk Partitioning and Managment tools
	3rd party Tools (partition magic)
	Windows install process
	Disk Managment Tool
		GUI tool available since Win2K+
		diskmgmt.msc or diskmgr.exe

--------------------------------------------
Disk Management Tool 
	Shows partitions/volumes on a disk
	Allows you to add/delete/format partitions/volumes
		Right-click on drive or partition/volume for menu options
	Drive statuses
		Online - Healthy and working
		Foreign - Dynamic disk moved from another computer
		Failed - damaged or corrupted
		Offline - corrupted?
--------------------------------------------
Disk Maintenance
	Error Checking (ScanDisk, Chkdsk)
		Finds bad clusters and denotes them as such
	Defragmentation (optimize drives)
		Can analyze and/or optimize drives
		Moves data around so files use contiguous clusters (important on HDD)
	To access, right click on drive in File Explorer and select Properties
