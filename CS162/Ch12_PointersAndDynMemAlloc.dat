------------------------------------------
Pointers
	A pointer is a variable that contains the memory address of a location at which data is stored.
	This location may be
		Another variable
		Memory that was dynamically allocated
	In a 32 bit application, pointers are always 32 bits (4 bytes)
	The type of data (char, int, etc..) a pointer is pointing to is important and specified when you declare the pointer.
	General syntax is:
		[[code]]
		dataType * identifier

------------------------------------------
Declaring Pointer Variables
	Pointer variables are declared as follows
	[[code]]
		// The following three lines are equivalant
		// The * must be between the type and identifer
		// Spaces can be on either side	of the *
		int* p1; [[desc I prefer this format<br>Because it's an integer pointer.  Pointer is part of the type.]]
		int *p2; [[desc Textbook author prefers this method<br>Reasons are it's consistent when declaring mulitple pointers on one line.(see below)<br>I suggest just not declaring multiple on one line.]]
		int * p3; [[desc www.cplusplus.com tutorials prefer this method.<br>Clearly they're fence sitters...]]
			
		//caution - If using method one, be careful when 
		//  declaring multiple pointer variables on one line
		int* p4, p5; // declares one int pointer and one int [[desc This does NOT declare two pointers.<br>Method 1 above kind of falls apart here...]] 
			
		int* p6, * p7; //declares two int pointers [[desc This declares two pointers]]
		
---------------------------------------------
Initializing Pointers
	A pointer should contain one of the following:
		A valid memory address
		0 (denoting it doesn't contain a valid memory address)
			0, NULL, and nullptr are all 0, but nullptr is preferred when dealing with pointers.
	Pointers can be initialized to NULL as follows:
	[[code]]
		// The following two lines declare
		// and initialize pointers to 0/NULL/nullptr.
		// 0 or NULL work, but nullptr is better
		int* p1=nullptr;	//best
		int* p2=0;		//works
	Pointers that contain 0/NULL/nullptr are called null pointers.
---------------------------------------------
Practice
	For each of the lines below, tell
		What type of variable(s) is/are created
		How much memory each occupies
		What the contents of the variable(s) are after the line executes
		[[code]]
			
			int* a;
				
			char* b, c;
				
			double* d=nullptr;
---------------------------------------------
"Address of" operator
	You can get the address of an existing variable using the address of operator (&).
	[[code]]
		int x=5;
		int* p;		//declares a pointer named p
			
		p=&x;		//stores address of x in p
			
---------------------------------------------
Dereferenceing operator
	If you want to reference (print, modify, etc..) the data a pointer points to, you need to use the dereferencing operator (*)
	Note: The * is used for lots of things, multiplication, declaring pointers, and now dereferencing them!
	[[code]]
		int x=5;
		int* p;		//declares a pointer named p
			
		p=&x;		//stores address of x in p
		cout << *p; 	//print out what p points to
		cout << endl;
			
		*p=*p+7; 	//add 7 to the location p points to
			
			
		(*p)++; //Adds one more to what p points to [[desc The ( ) are to assure we add to what p points to, not to p itself<br>Because you CAN add to pointers, thereby changing what they point to.<br>And if we left off the ( ) that's exactly what would happen.]]
		cout << *p; //print out what p points to
		cout << endl;	
---------------------------------------------
Practice
	Given
		number is at address 0x12345678;
		ptr is at address 0x1234567c;
	What does the following print out?
	[[code]]
		double number=4.2;
		double* ptr=&number;
			
		cout << &ptr << endl;
		cout << ptr << endl;
		cout << *ptr << endl;
---------------------------------------------
new operator
	Memory can be dynamically allocated using the new operator
		Pointer to allocated memory is returned
	For example:
	[[code]]
		int* p1 = new int;
		int* p2 = 0;
		p2 = new int;
		
		*p1 = 7;
		*p2 = 5;
		cout << (*p1 + *p2) << endl;
		
---------------------------------------------
delete operator
	Memory allocated using new should be freed up using delete
	[[code]]
		int* p1 = new int;
		int* p2 = 0;
		p2 = new int;
			
		*p1 = 7;
		*p2 = 5;
		cout << (*p1 + *p2) << endl;	
			
		delete p1;
		delete p2;
---------------------------------------------
Practice
	Write code that does the following:
		creates a char pointer and intializes it to NULL.
		uses new to allocate memory for a new char, storing the resulting address in the pointer var
		sets the dynamically allocated memory to 'Z';
		prints out the value in the dynamically allocated memory.
		frees up the dynamically allocated memory
---------------------------------------------
Memory leaks
	If you dynamically allocate memory and then lose track of it (by changing the pointer to something else) before freeing it up, you have a memory leak.
	[[code]]
		int* p1 = new int;
		int* p2 = 0;
		p2 = new int;
			
		// changing the pointers without freeing up 
		// memory first results in memory leaks
		p1 = new int; 	// memory leak! [[desc p1 used to contain a pointer to the memory we allocated previously (on line 1).<br>We've now replaced that pointer with a new one to some new memory<br>But we didn't free up the original memory... and now we can't... because we don't have a pointer to it anymore... oops.]]
		p2 = 0; 		// memory leak! [[desc p2 used to contain a pointer to the memory we allocated previously (on line 2).<br>We've now replaced that with NULL.<br>But we didn't free up the original memory... and now we can't... because we don't have a pointer to it anymore... oops. ]]
			
	The leaked memory will be unavailable to anyone until the program ends. 
	When the program ends, the OS will free up all memory that was allocated to it.

---------------------------------------------
Dynamic arrays
	You can allocate memory for an array of elements as follows
	[[code]]
		//allocate enough memory for 100 integers!
		int* p1 = new int[100]; [[desc This allocates 400 contiguous bytes (Each int is 4 bytes, 4*100=400), and returns the address of the beginning of the allocated block (the address of the first element)]]
			
		...
			
		//when you free it up, be sure to use the []!
		delete [] p1; [[desc This frees up all 400 bytes.<br>The [ ] are important.  Without them it would only free up the first 4 bytes (the space occupied by a single int)]]
--------------------------------------------------
Practice
	How much memory is dynamically allocated by each of the following lines:
	[[code]]
			
		char* cp = new char[20];
		int* ip = new int[10];
				
	What is wrong with the following code?
	[[code]]
			
		int* p1 = new int[10];
		delete p1;
			
--------------------------------------------------
Pointer Operations
	You can do math on pointers
	Adding/subtracting 1 to/from a pointer changes it by the size of the item it points to.
	The following example shows how this might be used
	[[code]]
		//allocate enough memory for 10 integers!
		int* p1 = new int[10];
		int* p2 = p1; [[desc We're going to use this pointer to point to the various different integers in the array<br>We start out by pointing to the first, which is what p1 points to.<br>We don't want to change p1 because we need it later to free up the memory.]]
			
		//put some data in our allocated memory
		for(int x=0; x<10; x++) { [[desc We're going to fill up 10 memory locations]]
			*p2 = x*x;
			p2++;	[[desc Adds 4 (the size of an int) to the address stored in p2<br>So it now points to the next integer location]]
		}
			
		//print out the data backwards
		p2--; [[desc Subtracts 4 (the size of an int) from the address stored in p2<br>So it now points to the previous integer location.<br>We need this because the last time through the for loop above we incremented p2 to point ot a location beyond our allocated memory.]]
		while (*p2 != 0) { [[desc p2 currently points at the last of our 10 memory locations.<br>We put 0 in the first location, so we're going to go back through them until we find the one with 0]] 
			cout << *p2;
			p2--;	[[desc Subtracts 4 (the size of an int) from the address stored in p2<br>So it now points to the previous integer location]]
		}		
			
		//free it up
		delete [] p1;		
------------------------------------------------------------
Practice
	What does the following print out?
	[[code]]
			
		char letters[] = "letters";
		char* cp = letters;
			
		cp++;
		cp++;
			
		cout << *cp;
			
------------------------------------------------------------
Practice
	Given the array starts at address 0x33221100, what does the following print out?
	[[code]]
			
		int numbers[] = {1,2,3,4};
		int* np = numbers;
			
		np++;
		cout << *np << endl;
		cout << np << endl;
			
------------------------------------------------------------
