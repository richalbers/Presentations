Ch04 - CPU Architecture
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Intel architectures
	IA32 - 32 Bit Intel Architecture 
		more commonly known as x86 
	IA64 - 64 Bit Intel Architecture
		Itanium architecture
		Probably better, but incompatible with x86.
		Used in some servers. 
		Discontinued in 2019.
	X64 - 64 bit extension to IA32 (x86)
		The 64 bit architecture used by most 64 bit Intel chips
		Created by AMD, adopted by Intel.
		Backwards compatible with x86

CISC & RISC
General Differences:
	CISC - Complex Instruction Set Computer
		Has many, sometimes complex, instructions
			A single Instruction can encompass multiple low-level operations
		Most Notable Example: 
			Intel x86 processors used in desktops/servers
	RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computer
		Made of of fewer, simpler instructions
		Most notable example: 
			ARM processors used in smartphones
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CISC
	Has a large number of instructions and addressing modes
	Instructions may be very complex
		One line of assembly might, for example, load two values from memory, multiply them, and store the result
	So you end up with fewer lines of assembly to accomplish a task
	But complex instructions take longer (more clock cycles) than simple instructions
	And not all instructions take the same amount of time to execute
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
RISC
	A smaller set of simple rinstructions
	It would require 4 lines of assembly to load two values from memory, multiply them, and store the result
	But all instructions take the same amount of time so they can be pipelined efficiently
	Also early RISC chips were able to run at higher clock speeds then CISC chips
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pipelining
	Pipelining involves executing multiple sequential instructions at the same time 
	For example: a classic RISC instruction involves a few steps
		Fetch
		Decode
		Execute	[[img RISC_Pipeline.PNG]]
		Memory Access
		WriteBack
	A different part of the CPU is used for each of these steps, so the processor can be working a 5 different instructions at the same time, as shown in the diagram to the right
	[[Process is described in detail on wikipedia!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining]]

CISC RISC Comparison

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The winner is?
	CISC v RISC is largely a historical debate, modern processors are, at their core, all RISC.  
	Ever since the Pentium Pro (1995), the Intel x86-64 (CISC) instruction set is translated to RISC microcode (MicroOps) on chip prior to execution, so they can be pipelined
	So the assembly provides a "CISC interface" to a RISC architecture.
		This allowed for backwards compatibility
